# UI Health Bar and Stats Implementation

## Overview
Added a complete UI overlay system showing player health and game statistics in real-time.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. UI Scene Structure

**File:** `scenes/game_ui.tscn`

```
GameUI (CanvasLayer)
└── Container (MarginContainer)
    └── HBoxContainer
        ├── HealthBox (HBoxContainer) - Top-Left
        │   ├── HealthLabel ("HP:")
        │   ├── HealthBar (ProgressBar)
        │   └── HealthNumbers ("100/100")
        └── StatsBox (VBoxContainer) - Top-Right
            ├── KillsLabel ("Kills: 0")
            └── TimeLabel ("Time: 00:00")
```

### 2. UI Script

**File:** `scripts/game_ui.gd`

**Features:**
- Real-time health bar updates
- Kill counter tracking
- Time survived counter (MM:SS format)
- Automatic timer that counts from game start

**Functions:**
- `update_health(current, maximum)` - Updates health display
- `update_kills(count)` - Sets kill count
- `increment_kills()` - Adds one to kill count
- `update_time(seconds)` - Formats and displays elapsed time

### 3. Player Integration

**File:** `scripts/player.gd`

**Added:**
- `signal health_changed(current: int, maximum: int)` - Emitted when health changes
- Emits signal in `_ready()` for initial health
- Emits signal in `take_damage()` when taking damage
- Health clamped to 0 minimum

### 4. Enemy Integration

**File:** `scripts/enemy.gd`

**Added:**
- `signal enemy_died` - Emitted when enemy is killed
- Signal emission in `die()` function
- Allows UI to track kills

### 5. Main Scene Connections

**File:** `scenes/main.tscn`

**Connections:**
- Player's `health_changed` → GameUI's `update_health()`
- Enemy's `enemy_died` → GameUI's `increment_kills()`
- Enemy2's `enemy_died` → GameUI's `increment_kills()`

## Visual Design

### Layout
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HP: ████████░░ 80/100          Kills: 2  │
│                              Time: 01:23  │
│                                           │
│            [GAME AREA]                    │
│                                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Color Scheme
- **Health Bar Fill:** Blue (RGB: 0.2, 0.6, 1.0) - matches player color
- **Health Bar Background:** Dark gray semi-transparent (RGB: 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8)
- **Text:** White with black drop shadow for readability
- **Font Size:** 20px for all elements

### Spacing
- Margins: 20px from screen edges
- Element separation: 10px between health components, 5px between stats
- Health bar size: 200x30 pixels

## Features

### Health Display
- Visual progress bar (blue fill)
- Numerical display (e.g., "100/100")
- Updates instantly when taking damage
- Shows both current and maximum health

### Kill Counter
- Tracks all enemy deaths
- Increments automatically
- Displayed as "Kills: X"
- Right-aligned for visibility

### Time Tracker
- Counts up from game start
- MM:SS format (e.g., "02:34")
- Updates every frame
- Displayed as "Time: MM:SS"
- Right-aligned below kills

## Technical Details

### Signal Flow

**Health Updates:**
```
Player takes damage
    ↓
health_changed signal emitted
    ↓
GameUI.update_health() called
    ↓
HealthBar and HealthNumbers updated
```

**Kill Tracking:**
```
Enemy health reaches 0
    ↓
enemy_died signal emitted
    ↓
GameUI.increment_kills() called
    ↓
Kill counter incremented and displayed
```

**Time Tracking:**
```
GameUI._process(delta) called every frame
    ↓
time_elapsed += delta
    ↓
update_time() formats and displays
```

### Performance Considerations
- Time update happens in `_process()` (every frame)
- Health and kills update only when changed (event-driven)
- No unnecessary redraws
- Minimal overhead

## Testing Checklist

✅ Health bar displays 100/100 at game start  
✅ Health bar updates when player takes damage from projectiles  
✅ Health bar updates when player is near enemies  
✅ Kill counter starts at 0  
✅ Kill counter increments when enemy dies  
✅ Time counter starts at 00:00  
✅ Time counter increases each second  
✅ Time displays in MM:SS format  
✅ UI doesn't obstruct gameplay  
✅ Text is readable with drop shadows  
✅ UI elements properly aligned (left/right)  

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `scenes/game_ui.tscn` - UI scene with all visual elements
- `scripts/game_ui.gd` - UI controller script

**Modified:**
- `scripts/player.gd` - Added health_changed signal
- `scripts/enemy.gd` - Added enemy_died signal
- `scenes/main.tscn` - Added UI instance and signal connections

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Health Bar Color Changes**
   - Green when > 70% health
   - Yellow when 30-70% health
   - Red when < 30% health

2. **Damage Flash Effect**
   - Screen flash when taking damage
   - Health bar shake animation

3. **Additional Stats**
   - Damage dealt
   - Accuracy
   - Longest survival time

4. **Game Over Screen**
   - Display final stats
   - Restart button
   - Score/rank system

5. **Polish Effects**
   - Number pop-ups when killing enemies
   - Sound effects for UI updates
   - Animated counters (number roll-up)

6. **Pause Menu**
   - Pause game with ESC
   - Resume/quit options
   - Settings

7. **Level-Up Notifications**
   - Visual indicator for upgrades
   - Choice selection UI

## Usage

The UI is fully automatic and requires no player input:
- Health updates happen automatically when damaged
- Kills count automatically when enemies die
- Time tracks automatically from game start

All systems are connected via signals for clean, decoupled architecture.
