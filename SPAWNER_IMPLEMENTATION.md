# Enemy Spawning System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a dynamic enemy spawning system that continuously spawns enemies at increasing difficulty, creating endless survival gameplay.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enemy Spawner Script

**File:** `scripts/enemy_spawner.gd`

**Core Features:**
- Continuous enemy spawning at timed intervals
- Progressive difficulty scaling over time
- Smart spawn positioning (away from player, within arena)
- Automatic signal connection to UI for kill tracking
- Configurable parameters for tuning

### 2. Spawner Configuration

**Exported Parameters (tunable in editor):**
- `initial_spawn_interval: 5.0` seconds - Starting spawn rate
- `min_spawn_interval: 1.0` seconds - Fastest possible spawn rate
- `initial_enemies_per_wave: 1` - Starting enemy count per wave
- `max_enemies_per_wave: 5` - Maximum enemies per wave
- `spawn_distance_min: 10.0` units - Minimum distance from player
- `spawn_distance_max: 15.0` units - Maximum distance from player
- `arena_radius: 20.0` units - Maximum spawn area radius
- `difficulty_increase_interval: 30.0` seconds - How often difficulty increases

### 3. Spawn Position Logic

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate random angle (0-360°) around player
2. Choose random distance between min and max
3. Calculate position relative to player
4. Clamp to arena bounds
5. Instantiate enemy at calculated position

**Prevents:**
- Spawning on top of player
- Spawning outside arena bounds
- Predictable spawn patterns

### 4. Difficulty Scaling

**Every 30 seconds:**
- Spawn interval decreases by 0.5 seconds (faster spawns)
- Enemies per wave increases by 1 (more enemies)
- Continues until reaching min/max values

**Example Progression:**
```
Time 0s:    1 enemy every 5 seconds
Time 30s:   1 enemy every 4.5 seconds
Time 60s:   2 enemies every 4 seconds
Time 90s:   2 enemies every 3.5 seconds
Time 120s:  3 enemies every 3 seconds
Time 150s:  3 enemies every 2.5 seconds
Time 180s:  4 enemies every 2 seconds
Time 210s:  4 enemies every 1.5 seconds
Time 240s:  5 enemies every 1 second (max difficulty)
```

### 5. Main Scene Integration

**File:** `scenes/main.tscn`

**Changes:**
- Added EnemySpawner node as child of Main
- Removed static Enemy and Enemy2 instances
- Spawner automatically finds player reference
- Spawner automatically connects to GameUI for kill tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Node Structure
```
Main (Node3D)
├── DirectionalLight3D
├── Camera3D
├── WorldEnvironment
├── Ground (StaticBody3D)
├── Player (CharacterBody3D instance)
├── EnemySpawner (Node3D with script) ← NEW
└── GameUI (CanvasLayer instance)
```

### Spawn Flow
```
Spawn Timer Timeout
    ↓
spawn_wave() called
    ↓
For each enemy in wave:
    get_spawn_position() → Calculate valid position
    enemy_scene.instantiate() → Create enemy
    add_child to scene → Add to game
    Connect signals → Link to UI
    ↓
Print debug info
```

### Difficulty Scaling Flow
```
Difficulty Timer Timeout (every 30s)
    ↓
increase_difficulty() called
    ↓
Decrease spawn_interval by 0.5s (min: 1.0s)
    ↓
Increase enemies_per_wave by 1 (max: 5)
    ↓
Update spawn timer
    ↓
Print debug info
```

## Key Features

### Dynamic Signal Connection
Spawner automatically connects each spawned enemy's `enemy_died` signal to the UI's `increment_kills` method:
```gdscript
if game_ui and enemy.has_signal("enemy_died"):
    enemy.enemy_died.connect(game_ui.increment_kills)
```

This means:
- Kill counter works automatically
- No manual signal setup needed
- Scales to infinite enemies

### Smart Positioning
Enemies spawn:
- In a ring around the player (10-15 units away)
- At random angles for unpredictability
- Never outside the arena bounds
- With proper Y-position (ground level)

### Performance Considerations
- Uses Timer nodes (efficient, non-blocking)
- Preloads enemy scene once (not per spawn)
- Minimal calculations per spawn
- No collision checks (assumes calculated positions are valid)

## Testing Results

✅ Enemies spawn continuously every 5 seconds initially  
✅ Spawn positions are 10-15 units from player  
✅ Enemies never spawn outside arena  
✅ Difficulty increases every 30 seconds  
✅ Spawn rate accelerates over time  
✅ Multiple enemies spawn per wave as game progresses  
✅ Kill counter tracks all spawned enemy deaths  
✅ No performance issues with many spawns  
✅ Game now has endless survival gameplay  

## Gameplay Impact

### Before Spawner:
- Game had exactly 2 enemies
- Game "ended" after killing both
- No progression or challenge increase
- ~30 seconds of gameplay total

### After Spawner:
- Infinite enemies spawn continuously
- Game never ends (until player dies)
- Difficulty increases naturally over time
- True endless survival roguelite experience
- Encourages "just one more run" mentality

## Configuration Tips

**For Easier Game:**
- Increase `initial_spawn_interval` (slower spawns)
- Decrease `max_enemies_per_wave` (fewer enemies)
- Increase `difficulty_increase_interval` (slower ramp)

**For Harder Game:**
- Decrease `initial_spawn_interval` (faster spawns)
- Increase `max_enemies_per_wave` (more enemies)
- Decrease `difficulty_increase_interval` (faster ramp)
- Decrease `spawn_distance_min` (enemies spawn closer)

**For Different Arena Sizes:**
- Adjust `arena_radius` to match ground plane size
- Adjust `spawn_distance_max` accordingly
- Keep `spawn_distance_min` > player attack range (2 units)

## Debug Output

Spawner logs:
- "Spawned enemy at: [position]" - Each enemy spawn
- "Difficulty increased! Interval: X Enemies per wave: Y" - Each difficulty increase
- "Warning: Player not found for enemy spawner" - If player missing

## Known Limitations

1. **No Spawn Cooldown on Player Proximity**
   - Enemies can spawn near player even if surrounded
   - Future: Check for clear space before spawning

2. **No Enemy Type Variation**
   - All spawned enemies are identical
   - Future: Spawn different enemy types at higher difficulty

3. **Fixed Difficulty Curve**
   - Linear progression hardcoded
   - Future: Configurable difficulty curves

4. **No Maximum Enemy Count**
   - Can spawn unlimited enemies
   - Future: Optional cap on simultaneous enemies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enemy Variety**
   - Different enemy types at different difficulty levels
   - Boss spawns at specific times
   - Elite enemies with special abilities

2. **Spawn Patterns**
   - Wave patterns (circle, line, cross)
   - Surprise swarms
   - Safe periods between waves

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Spawn warning particles
   - Ground markers before spawn
   - Sound cues for incoming waves

4. **Dynamic Difficulty**
   - Adjust based on player performance
   - Easier if player struggling
   - Harder if player dominating

5. **Spawn Zones**
   - Multiple spawn points
   - Door/portal entry points
   - Themed spawn areas

## Files Modified

**Created:**
- `scripts/enemy_spawner.gd` - Spawning system

**Modified:**
- `scenes/main.tscn` - Added spawner, removed static enemies
- `README.md` - Updated roadmap with backlog items

## Integration Notes

The spawner is fully automatic and requires no player input or additional setup. It:
- Finds player automatically on ready
- Finds UI automatically on ready
- Connects all signals automatically
- Scales difficulty automatically
- Works with existing enemy/UI systems

Simply add the EnemySpawner node to any scene with a Player and GameUI, and it works out of the box.
